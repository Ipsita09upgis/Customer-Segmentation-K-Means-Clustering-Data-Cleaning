# ðŸ§¼ K-Means Clustering: Data Cleaning

The objective of this notebook is to prepare the online retail dataset for clustering analysis. The steps include loading, exploring, cleaning, engineering features, transforming the data, and finally saving the cleaned dataset. This data preparation pipeline will help identify customer segments using unsupervised learning techniques like K-means clustering.

## ðŸ“„ File Overview

- `K Means Clustering Data Cleaning_Ipsita.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data cleaning operations and saving the cleaned dataset.
- `Online Retail Cleaned.xlsx`: Cleaned version of the original dataset, saved for further analysis.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used is an Excel file containing online retail transactions with fields such as:
- `InvoiceNo`
- `StockCode`
- `Description`
- `Quantity`
- `InvoiceDate`
- `UnitPrice`
- `CustomerID`
- `Country`

## âœ… Data Cleaning Steps

### 1. Handle Missing Values
- Checked for null values using `isnull().sum()`.
- Dropped rows missing `CustomerID` or `Description`.

### 2. Remove Duplicates
- Removed duplicate records using `drop_duplicates()`.

### 3. Filter Invalid Transactions
- Removed rows where `Quantity <= 0` or `UnitPrice <= 0`.
- Excluded cancelled transactions (`InvoiceNo` starting with 'C').

### 4. Correct Data Types
- Converted `CustomerID` to integer for consistency.

## ðŸ’¾ Save Cleaned Data

After cleaning, the data was saved back to an Excel file for reuse:

```python
df.to_excel("Online Retail Cleaned.xlsx", index=False)
